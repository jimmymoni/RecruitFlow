## 💡 RECENT DECISIONS & LEARNINGS

### Test-First Development Strategy
- **Decision**: Always build test components for critical features first
- **Rationale**: Faster debugging, isolated testing, safer implementation
- **Example**: AuthTest.tsx helped us identify and fix authentication issues quickly
- **Documentation**: Added to CLAUDE.md as standard practice

### Authentication Approach
- **Decision**: JWT with Supabase backend, React Context for state
- **Implementation**: Working test panel proves core logic is solid
- **Next**: Convert to production-ready modal interface

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT

### Minor Issues to Address
1. Remove debug logging from production components
2. Optimize bundle size (lazy loading for large components)
3. Add proper error boundaries
4. Implement loading states for all API calls
5. Add form validation messages

### Documentation Updates Needed
1. API endpoint documentation
2. Component prop interfaces
3. Database schema documentation
4. Deployment guide
