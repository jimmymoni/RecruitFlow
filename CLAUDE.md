## Development Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **TypeScript First**: All components use strict TypeScript with proper interfaces
- **Component Architecture**: Single-responsibility components with clear prop interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient re-renders
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Premium UI Standards
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent dark-900 to dark-100 color scale
- **Glassmorphism**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-dark-800 to-dark-700` backgrounds
- **Premium Effects**: `shadow-premium`, `shadow-glow`, `backdrop-blur-sm`
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion with consistent hover/tap effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints

### Animation Patterns
```tsx
// Standard hover/tap animations
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}

// Container animations
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 }
  }
}

// Item animations  
const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { y: 20, opacity: 0 },
  visible: { y: 0, opacity: 1, transition: { duration: 0.5 } }
}
```

### Data Structure Patterns
- **Interfaces**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data
- **Mock Data**: Realistic test data that matches production scenarios
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper type safety
- **API Ready**: Structure designed for easy backend integration

### Current System Features
- **Candidate Management**: Complete CRUD with bulk operations and communication tracking
- **Communication System**: Timeline view with filtering, add forms, and interaction history
- **Premium UI**: Dark theme with neon accents and smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts and touch interactions

### Development Strategy: Test-First Approach
**For critical features (authentication, payments, data operations), always:**

1. **Build a minimal test component first**
   - Create simple debug panels (like `AuthTest.tsx`)
   - Use inline styles for quick visibility
   - Include console logging for debugging
   - Position as floating panel (`position: fixed`)

2. **Test core functionality isolated**
   - Verify API connections work
   - Test state management separately
   - Validate data flow before UI complexity
   - Use simple form inputs with clear styling

3. **Benefits of this approach:**
   - ✅ Faster debugging and iteration
   - ✅ Isolates issues from UI complexity
   - ✅ Provides immediate feedback
   - ✅ Safer for critical features
   - ✅ Creates reusable test utilities

4. **Example pattern:**
```tsx
// Always create [FeatureName]Test.tsx first
export const AuthTest = () => {
  // Simple form with visible inputs
  // Direct API calls with logging
  // Clear success/error feedback
  // Floating panel positioning
}
```

5. **Once core works, integrate into main UI**
   - Transfer working logic to production components
   - Keep test component for future debugging
   - Document any edge cases discovered

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Use `/feature-plan` command before starting new features
2. **Test-First**: Build minimal test component for critical features
3. **Implementation**: Follow established patterns and component structure
4. **Testing**: Use `/test-feature` to verify functionality
5. **Review**: Use `/ui-review` to ensure design consistency
6. **Commit**: Use `/commit-check` before committing changes

### Custom Commands Available
- `/feature-plan` - Strategic feature planning and architecture
- `/ui-review` - Design system consistency check
- `/test-feature` - Comprehensive feature testing
- `/commit-check` - Pre-commit code quality review

### Strategic Context
- **Competitive Analysis**: See `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed market research and positioning strategy
- **Document Management**: Critical differentiator - 55% of HR leaders overwhelmed by current solutions
- **Pricing Strategy**: 70% cost advantage over competitors like RecruitCRM ($35 vs $95/month)
- **Target Market**: Small agencies underserved by expensive enterprise solutions
