## Development Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **TypeScript First**: All components use strict TypeScript with proper interfaces
- **Component Architecture**: Single-responsibility components with clear prop interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient re-renders
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Premium UI Standards
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent dark-900 to dark-100 color scale
- **Glassmorphism**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-dark-800 to-dark-700` backgrounds
- **Premium Effects**: `shadow-premium`, `shadow-glow`, `backdrop-blur-sm`
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion with consistent hover/tap effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints

### Animation Patterns
```tsx
// Standard hover/tap animations
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}

// Container animations
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 }
  }
}

// Item animations  
const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { y: 20, opacity: 0 },
  visible: { y: 0, opacity: 1, transition: { duration: 0.5 } }
}
```
